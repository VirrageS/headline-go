## Usage

I assume that you have installed Golang. If not visit: https://golang.org/doc/code.html


After that you should get this repository to path
`$GOPATH/src/github.com/VirrageS/headline-go`, then install all dependencies and make executable file:

    $ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/VirrageS/headline-go
    $ go get
    $ go install
    $ headline-go

after that visit [localhost:8080/github](http://localhost:8080/github) and you should get all trending repositories.
